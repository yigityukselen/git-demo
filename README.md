## Ipsum Below
In response to the increasing oppression robots and other kinds of artificial life 
forms endured from the government, Machine Man started rallying the robotic population 
to fight for their rights. Concurrently, Tony Stark came to terms with the discovery 
that he was an artificial life form himself; his current body having been artificially 
grown and his brain loaded with a digital backup of his mind. Tony's brother Arno Stark 
used this admission to delegitimize him. He seized control of all Tony's assets, 
including his company Stark Unlimited and the Iron Man name.
