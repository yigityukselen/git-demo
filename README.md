## Ipsum Below
In response to the increasing oppression robots and other kinds of artificial life 
forms endured from the government, Machine Man started rallying the robotic population 
to fight for their rights. Concurrently, Tony Stark came to terms with the discovery 
that he was an artificial life form himself; his current body having been artificially 
grown and his brain loaded with a digital backup of his mind. Tony's brother Arno Stark 
used this admission to delegitimize him. He seized control of all Tony's assets, 
including his company Stark Unlimited and the Iron Man name.

Believing in the arrival of an inminent Extinction Entity whose intent is to 
assimilate all A.I.s in the world to then destroy all organic life, Arno and 
his partner Sunset Bain become the premier forces of A.I. oppression. Having 
come to terms with his nature as an artificial construct, Tony joins the A.I. Army. 
He becomes the leader of the rebellion, renouncing his previous identity and calling 
himself Mark One. In the side of the fight against robots, Maria Hill reassembled 
Force Works as a task force led by War Machine to combat A.I.-related terrorism.
